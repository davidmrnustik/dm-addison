# Betting Data Assignment Project

An assessment project for Addison Global. [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) has been used to bootstrap the project. I've chosen React for its concept of modular/component structure, VirtualDOM feature and fast rendering.

## Install / Run

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## App

React app that fetches betting data and allows user to select betting opportunity.
